          Warning: our content can be as dark as a black hole at times. If you're easily offended or have a sensitivity to jokes that push
            the boundaries, this may not be the ideal place for you. However, if you're ready to embrace the darkness
            and have a good laugh, strap in and enjoy the wickedly humorous journey ahead! Just remember, our jokes are
            like shadows - they may be dark, but they'll never bite!
